# Point on Feature Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating the `pointOnFeature` function in the turf_dart library.

## Function Overview

The `pointOnFeature` function returns a point that is guaranteed to be on or inside a feature. This is useful for placing labels, icons, or other markers on geographic features.

The function behavior varies by geometry type:
- **Point**: Returns the original point unchanged
- **LineString**: Returns the midpoint of the first segment
- **Polygon**: Returns a point inside the polygon (preferably the centroid)
- **MultiPolygon**: Uses the first polygon to compute a point
- **FeatureCollection**: Returns a point on the largest feature

## Directory Structure

- **`/in`**: Input GeoJSON files with different geometry types
- **`/out`**: Output files showing the points generated by `pointOnFeature`
- **`visualization.geojson`**: Combined visualization of all inputs and their resulting points

## Example Files

1. **Point Example**: Shows that `pointOnFeature` returns the original point
2. **LineString Example**: Shows how `pointOnFeature` finds the midpoint of the first line segment
3. **Polygon Examples**: Show how `pointOnFeature` returns a point inside the polygon
4. **MultiPolygon Example**: Shows how `pointOnFeature` uses the first polygon
5. **FeatureCollection Example**: Shows how `pointOnFeature` finds a point on the largest feature

## Visualization

The `visualization.geojson` file combines all examples into one visualization. When viewed in a GeoJSON viewer, it shows:
- Original geometries in blue
- Points generated by `pointOnFeature` in red with different markers:
  - Stars for points
  - Circles for linestrings
  - Triangles for polygons
  - Squares for multipolygons
  - Circle-stroked for feature collections

Each point includes a description explaining how it was generated.

## Running the Examples

To regenerate the examples and visualization:

1. Run the output generator:
   ```
   dart test/examples/point_on_feature/generate_outputs.dart
   ```

2. Run the visualization generator:
   ```
   dart test/examples/point_on_feature/generate_visualization.dart
   ```

## Use Cases

The `pointOnFeature` function is commonly used for:
- Placing labels on geographic features
- Positioning icons or markers on features
- Finding representative points for complex geometries
- Generating points for clustering or other spatial operations
