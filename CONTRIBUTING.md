Welcome and thank you for deciding to contribute to the project!

Here is how cooperation works perfectly at [Turf Dart](https://github.com/dartclub/turf_dart)

## Code of conduct
By participating, you are expected to uphold international human rights and fundamental freedoms!
To put it simply, be kind to each other. 

## Get started
- Get the [Dart tools](https://dart.dev/tools)
- Clone the repository: ```git clone git@github.com:dartclub/turf_dart.git```
- Navigate to project's folder in terminal & get its dependencies:  ```dart pub get```
- Go through [Implementation Process](#implementation-process)
- Import the library in your code and use it. For example:
```dart
import 'package:turf/helpers.dart';
import 'package:turf/src/line_segment.dart';

  Feature<Polygon> poly = Feature<Polygon>(
    geometry: Polygon(coordinates: [
      [
        Position(0, 0),
        Position(2, 2),
        Position(0, 1),
        Position(0, 0),
      ],
      [
        Position(0, 0),
        Position(1, 1),
        Position(0, 1),
        Position(0, 0),
      ],
    ]),
  );

var total = segmentReduce<int>(poly, (previousValue,
        currentSegment,
        initialValue,
        featureIndex,
        multiFeatureIndex,
        geometryIndex,
        segmentIndex) {
      if (previousValue != null) {
        previousValue++;
      }
      return previousValue;
    }, 0, combineNestedGeometries: false);
// total.length ==  6
```

## Structure of modules
```
TURF_DART/lib/<MODULE NAME>.dart // public facing API, exports the implementation
         │   │
         │   └───src/<MODULE NAME>.dart // the implementation
         │ 
         └───benchmark/<MODULE NAME>_benchmark.dart
         │
         └───test/components/<MODULE NAME>_test.dart // all the related tests
```
## Implementation process
- Check the Backlog/Issues for similar issues
- Create a new branch _feature-_ from _main_
- Create a _draft Pull request_, mention in it the associated issues
- **Implement**
  - Document everything [properly](#documentation)
  - If you are importing tests, comments etc. from [Turfjs](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf), please make sure you refactor it so it conforms with Dart syntax.
  - **Write [tests](https://dart.dev/guides/testing)**―Keep an eye on [Turfjs'](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf) implementation
    - run the the test: ```dart test test/components/XXX.dart```
  - **Write [benchmarks](https://pub.dev/packages/benchmark)**―have a look at our [implementation](https://github.com/dartclub/turf_dart/tree/main/benchmark)
    - run the benchmark: ```dart pub run benchmark```
- Commit
- Convert to real Pull request _ready for review_
- Code review / mention a reviewer from [contributors list](https://github.com/dartclub/turf_dart/graphs/contributors) 


## Documentation
We follow [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/documentation) guidelines for documentation.

After going through the [Implementation Process](#implementation-process), please mention the made changes in [README.md](https://github.com/dartclub/turf_dart/blob/main/README.md)

In order to add to this very documentation, please develop CONTRIBUTING.md in [documentation branch](https://github.com/dartclub/turf_dart/tree/documentation)

## GeoJSON Object Model
If you have not read our [README.md](https://github.com/dartclub/turf_dart/blob/main/README.md) this diagram will give you a lot of information. Please consider looking our [notable design decisions](https://github.com/dartclub/turf_dart/blob/main/README.md#notable-design-decisions).
